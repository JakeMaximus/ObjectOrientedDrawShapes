How to Draw multiple Shapes, change line size, and colour of the line


1.	Add an icon to draw a square in the toolbar. The program should be able to draw a square with 2-point clicks in the drawing canvas when the square drawing icon is activated in the toolbar.

2.	Add an icon to draw an oval in the toolbar. The program should be able to draw an oval with 2-point clicks in the drawing canvas when the oval drawing icon is selected in the toolbar.

3.	Similar to requirement 1) and 2) above, you now add TWO other SHAPES (not the same as 1) and 2)) to the program

4.	A UML class diagram and UML sequence diagrams (for each use case) for the whole program (i.e. including lab 5 requirements and the new additional requirements as stated above)

5.	Reguired to use Java Swing
